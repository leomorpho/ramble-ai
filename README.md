**Transform hours of raw talking head footage into polished scripts in minutes.**

RambleAI is an AI-powered desktop application that preprocesses talking head videos, automatically selecting the best clips and reordering them into coherent scripts. Built with [Wails](https://wails.io), Go, and SvelteKit, it saves content creators 60-80% of their editing time.

## Why RambleAI?

RambleAI is NOT a video editor - it's a preprocessing tool that works WITH your favorite editor (Premiere, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve). It handles the tedious part of editing talking head content: finding the good takes, removing the rambling, and organizing everything into a coherent narrative.

### Key Benefits

- ⚡ **60-80% Time Savings**: What used to take 8 hours now takes 2-3 hours
- 🎯 **Smart Clip Selection**: AI identifies the best parts of your videos automatically
- 🧠 **AI Script Reordering**: Transform disorganized clips into coherent scripts
- 🔒 **100% Private**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- 🔄 **Works with Any Editor**: Export to your preferred video editing software

## Features

- 🎬 **Video Management**: Import and organize talking head footage
- ✂️ **Smart Highlight Extraction**: AI-powered clip selection with quality scoring  
- 🤖 **Flexible AI Integration**: Use any AI model via OpenRouter (bring your own API keys)
- 📝 **Accurate Transcription**: Word-level timestamps for precise editing
- 🎯 **Visual Timeline Editor**: Drag-to-resize highlight editing
- 📤 **Multiple Export Options**: Individual clips or stitched compilations
- 🌓 **Modern UI**: Dark/Light theme with native desktop performance
- 🚀 **Fast Processing**: Optimized for quick turnaround times

## Quick Start

## How It Works

### The RambleAI Workflow

1. **📤 Upload Footage**: Import your raw talking head video. AI analyzes speech patterns and content quality.

2. **🎯 Smart Selection**: AI identifies the best clips based on clarity, coherence, and narrative value.

3. **🧠 Script Reordering**: AI reorders selected clips into a coherent, engaging script using your choice of LLM.

4. **📦 Export & Handoff**: Export optimized scripts and clips ready for your favorite video editor.

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions with Earthly for continuous integration:

- ✅ Automated testing on every push
- 🔍 Code linting and formatting checks
- 📊 Test coverage reporting
- 🏗️ Multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- 🔐 Automated macOS code signing and notarization

### Running CI Locally with Earthly

```bash
# Install Earthly
brew install earthly/earthly/earthly

# Run full CI pipeline locally
earthly +ci

# Run specific targets
earthly +test
earthly +lint
earthly +build-frontend
```

### macOS Code Signing and Notarization

The project automatically signs and notarizes macOS builds using GitHub Actions. This requires the following GitHub secrets/variables:

#### Required Secrets
Set these in your GitHub repository settings under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`: Your Apple Developer certificate exported as .p12 and base64 encoded
- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: Password for your .p12 certificate  
- `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`: App-specific password for your Apple ID (generate at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com))

#### Required Variables (or Secrets)
Set these as either repository variables or secrets:

- `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email address
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID (10-character string like `ABCDE12345`)

#### Creating the Certificate File
1. Export your Apple Developer certificate from Keychain Access as a .p12 file
2. Convert to base64: `base64 YourCertificate.p12 | pbcopy`
3. Paste the result into the `APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` secret

#### Finding Your Team ID
Run this command on macOS to find your Team ID:
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

The signed and notarized app will be available for download as a build artifact and included in GitHub releases.
