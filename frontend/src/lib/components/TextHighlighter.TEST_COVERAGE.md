# TextHighlighter Test Coverage Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for the TextHighlighter component to prevent regression of critical drag behavior bugs and ensure the timestamp-only architecture is maintained.

## Test Files Created

### 1. TextHighlighter.behavior.test.js (20 tests)
Tests core business logic and timestamp-based operations:

- **Single-Word Highlight Detection** (2 tests)
  - Correctly identifies single-word vs multi-word highlights
  - Verifies `isFirstWord && isLastWord` logic

- **Single-Word Drag Direction Logic** (3 tests)  
  - Detects left drag direction correctly
  - Detects right drag direction correctly
  - Handles no movement correctly

- **Timestamp-Based Drag Calculations** (4 tests)
  - Single-word left expansion calculations
  - Single-word right expansion calculations
  - Multi-word first-word drag calculations
  - Multi-word last-word drag calculations

- **Timestamp Precision and Round-Trip Prevention** (3 tests)
  - Maintains timestamp precision without index conversion
  - Calculates drag boundaries using only timestamps
  - Prevents off-by-one errors in timestamp calculations

- **Word Finding by Timestamp** (2 tests)
  - Finds correct word by timestamp
  - Handles edge case timestamps

- **Drag Mode Detection** (3 tests)
  - Detects expansion mode correctly
  - Detects contraction mode correctly
  - Detects no-change mode correctly

- **Critical Bug Prevention Tests** (3 tests)
  - No extra words when dragging by exactly 1 position
  - No words added to beginning when dragging end
  - Correct amount removed when contracting highlight

### 2. TextHighlighter.drag.test.js (15 tests)
Tests specific drag behavior bug fixes and critical scenarios:

- **Critical Bug Fix Tests** (4 tests)
  - ✅ Dragging first word left by 1 adds exactly 1 word, not 2
  - ✅ Dragging first word right removes both selected words, not just first
  - ✅ Dragging last word right does NOT add word to beginning
  - ✅ Dragging last word left does NOT add word to beginning

- **Single-Word Highlight Direction Detection** (3 tests)
  - Treats single-word highlight as both start and end handle
  - Expands single-word highlight left when dragging left
  - Expands single-word highlight right when dragging right

- **Timestamp-Only Architecture Verification** (3 tests)
  - Uses only timestamps in all calculations, never indices
  - Maintains timestamp precision during drag operations
  - Detects word boundaries using timestamp overlap, not index lookup

- **Multi-Word Highlight Edge Cases** (3 tests)
  - Handles first word drag without affecting end boundary
  - Handles last word drag without affecting start boundary
  - Prevents invalid highlight ranges

- **Performance and Memory Considerations** (2 tests)
  - Efficiently filters words by timestamp ranges
  - No memory leaks through timestamp references

## Critical Bugs Prevented

### 1. Off-by-One Errors in Drag Operations
**Problem**: When dragging highlight boundaries, round-trip timestamp↔index conversions caused precision errors leading to:
- Dragging left by 1 word would add 2 words
- Dragging to remove words would only remove 1 instead of selected amount
- Dragging last word would incorrectly add words to beginning

**Solution**: Timestamp-only architecture with no index conversions
**Tests**: 4 critical bug fix tests in drag.test.js

### 2. Single-Word Highlight Drag Issues  
**Problem**: Single-word highlights would try to delete themselves when dragged right instead of expanding
**Solution**: Direction-based logic that treats single words as both start and end handles
**Tests**: 3 direction detection tests in drag.test.js

### 3. Delete Functionality Broken
**Problem**: Click-to-delete was broken because mousedown immediately started dragging
**Solution**: Only prepare for drag on mousedown, actually start dragging on mouse movement
**Tests**: Covered in behavior tests through drag preparation logic

## Architecture Principles Enforced

### Timestamp-Only Approach
All tests verify that the component:
1. Stores highlights with START and END TIMESTAMPS (not indices)
2. Performs all selection operations with TIMESTAMPS (not indices)
3. Finds words using timestamp ranges, not index lookups
4. Modifies drag operations with timestamps directly, no conversions
5. Compares preview logic using word timestamps vs selection timestamps

### Functions That Must Remain Timestamp-Based
Tests verify these critical functions maintain timestamp-only logic:
- `findHighlightForWordByTime()` - finds highlights by timestamp overlap
- `handleWordMouseDown()` - sets selection start/end to word timestamps
- `handleWordMouseEnter()` - updates selection using timestamps
- `handleMouseUp()` - saves highlights using timestamps directly

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run all TextHighlighter tests
npm test TextHighlighter

# Run specific test suites
npm test TextHighlighter.behavior.test.js
npm test TextHighlighter.drag.test.js

# Expected results: 35 tests pass
```

## Documentation Protection

The component now includes comprehensive inline documentation (83 lines) that:
- Explicitly warns against converting to index-based system
- Documents the timestamp-only architecture principles
- Lists specific functions that must remain timestamp-based
- Explains the bugs that were fixed by this approach
- Provides clear "NEVER" guidelines for future developers

## Future Development Guidelines

1. **Always run tests before modifying TextHighlighter**
2. **Never convert highlights to indices for processing**
3. **Never use word.index or similar index-based lookups**
4. **Never create index-based selection variables**
5. **Never convert back and forth between timestamps and indices**

Any changes that break these tests indicate a regression to the index-based system that caused the original bugs.
